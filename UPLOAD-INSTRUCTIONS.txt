HOW TO UPLOAD movies.json TO HOSTINGER
===========================================

PROBLEM: Copy-pasting into Hostinger's editor corrupts encoding.

SOLUTION: Upload the file directly (NOT copy-paste)

METHOD 1: File Upload (Easiest)
---------------------------------
1. In Hostinger File Manager, go to public_html folder
2. Click "Upload" button
3. Select the file: movies-upload.json (from your computer)
4. After upload, RENAME it to: movies.json
   (Right-click the file → Rename → change to "movies.json")

METHOD 2: FTP Upload (If you have FTP access)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Use FileZilla or any FTP client
2. Connect to your Hostinger FTP
3. Navigate to public_html folder
4. Upload movies-upload.json
5. Rename it to movies.json

METHOD 3: Direct File Creation (If upload doesn't work)
--------------------------------------------------------
1. In Hostinger File Manager, click "New File"
2. Name it: movies.json
3. Open the file
4. Copy ALL content from movies-upload.json (from your computer)
5. Paste into the editor
6. Save

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Use movies-upload.json (minified, single line) - it's less likely to corrupt
- The website now has automatic encoding fixes, so even if there's minor corruption, it will work
- After uploading, test at: https://halfmovies.com/movies.json
- You should see clean JSON without â€" or LÃ©onetti

# ⚠️ JustWatch Scraping Issue

## What Happened

I tried to scrape JustWatch, but it failed because:

1. **JustWatch blocks scraping** - They have anti-scraping measures
2. **Terms of Service** - Scraping violates their ToS
3. **Dynamic content** - Their site uses JavaScript to load data (can't parse with simple HTTP requests)
4. **Rate limiting** - They block automated requests

## ✅ Better Solution: Use TMDB API (Free & Legal)

Instead of scraping JustWatch, we can use **The Movie Database (TMDB) API** which is:
- ✅ **Free** - No cost
- ✅ **Legal** - Official API
- ✅ **Comprehensive** - Has movie data, posters, descriptions
- ✅ **No restrictions** - Designed for this purpose

## Next Steps

I can create a script that:
1. Uses TMDB API to get real movie data
2. Fetches posters, descriptions, genres, cast, etc.
3. Adds them to your database
4. You still need to add YouTube links manually

Would you like me to:
- **Option A:** Use TMDB API to get real movie data (recommended)
- **Option B:** Keep the movies as-is and you add YouTube links manually
- **Option C:** Try a different approach

Let me know which option you prefer!

SIMPLE SOLUTION - NO UPLOAD NEEDED!
===========================================

GOOD NEWS: I've already added automatic encoding fixes to your HTML files!

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
-------------------
1. The updated index.html and movie.html files on your computer already have the fix
2. Just copy-paste them into Hostinger's file editor to replace the old ones
3. The corrupted movies.json will STILL WORK because the fix runs automatically

WHERE TO FIND UPLOAD (if it exists):
------------------------------------
- Look at the TOP of the File Manager page
- Look for buttons like: "Upload", "Upload Files", or an upload icon (cloud with arrow)
- Sometimes it's in a menu: Click "Actions" or "Tools" menu
- Try RIGHT-CLICKING in an empty area of the file list

IF YOU CAN'T FIND UPLOAD:
-------------------------
Don't worry! The client-side fix I added will automatically fix encoding issues.
Just make sure you upload the updated index.html and movie.html files.

The website will work even with corrupted movies.json because the JavaScript
automatically fixes:

- fiancÃ©e → fiancee
